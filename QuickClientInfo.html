<!-- IDEAS

1)Potentiall make drop down list on the left side and move info to top of screen on right side. This should alow more space for items

2)Button to change keywords -> onclick put radio button next to words and finish button -> onclick opens text field to enter new word 
 -> on finish click send email with which keyword want to change -> message says to give me 24hr to change
